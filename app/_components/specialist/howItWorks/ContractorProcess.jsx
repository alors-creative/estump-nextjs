            2 Business Days to Respond Once You Pick Up a Job:{" "}
            <span>
              Once a homeowner submits their request and measurements, you have
              2 business days to respond. After confirming the job, you can
              schedule a convenient time for the stump removal.

            5 Working Days to Schedule and Complete:{" "}
            <span>
              You have 5 working days to schedule and complete the job once you
              accept the request. This provides enough flexibility to manage
              your workload, especially if youâ€™re dealing with storm-damaged
              stumps.

            Payment and Finalizing the Job:{" "}

              On the day of the job, perform the stump removal and collect the
              remaining payment directly from the homeowner. Be sure to mark the
              job as complete when finished.
