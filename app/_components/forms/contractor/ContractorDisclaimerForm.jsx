            I understand that eStump is a referral platform that connects me

            the booking, and that the remaining balance is to be paid directly
            by the client upon completion of the service.

            I understand that any additional work outside of the original quote
            provided to the client is not the responsibility of eStump, and it
            is solely my responsibility to negotiate and agree upon any extra
            charges with the client.
